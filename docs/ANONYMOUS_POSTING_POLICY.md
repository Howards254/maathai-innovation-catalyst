# Anonymous Posting Policy

## Purpose
The anonymous posting feature is designed to:
- Protect whistleblowers reporting environmental violations
- Encourage transparency about illegal deforestation or pollution
- Enable users to share sensitive information without fear of retaliation
- Support environmental activism and awareness

## How It Works

### Public Display
- Posts marked as anonymous show "Anonymous User" to all public viewers
- No profile picture or username is displayed
- Special "🔒 Anonymous" badge indicates anonymous posts

### Backend Storage
- **Real author identity IS stored** in the database (`realAuthorId` field)
- Only visible to platform administrators
- Required for legal compliance and abuse prevention

## Legal Compliance

### Data Retention
1. All posts (anonymous or not) store the real author's user ID
2. This data is encrypted and access-restricted
3. Can be disclosed to authorities if legally required

### When Identity May Be Revealed
- Court orders or legal subpoenas
- Investigation of illegal activity (not environmental reporting)
- Terms of Service violations (harassment, spam, etc.)
- National security concerns

## User Responsibilities

### Acceptable Use
✅ Reporting environmental violations
✅ Sharing sensitive environmental data
✅ Whistleblowing on illegal activities
✅ Discussing controversial environmental topics

### Prohibited Use
❌ Harassment or defamation
❌ False accusations without evidence
❌ Spam or commercial promotion
❌ Illegal content or activities
❌ Hate speech or discrimination

## Moderation

### Community Reporting
- Users can report anonymous posts for violations
- Moderators review flagged content
- Severe violations may result in identity disclosure to authorities

### Admin Access
- Platform administrators can view real author identity
- Access is logged and audited
- Only used for moderation and legal compliance

## Recommendations for Users

### When to Post Anonymously
- Reporting employer environmental violations
- Sharing information about government corruption
- Discussing sensitive local environmental issues
- Protecting yourself from potential retaliation

### When NOT to Post Anonymously
- General environmental discussions
- Building your reputation in the community
- Networking with other activists
- Sharing your own success stories

## Disclaimer

**Important**: While your identity is hidden from the public, it is NOT hidden from:
- Platform administrators
- Law enforcement (with proper legal process)
- Court orders or subpoenas

This is a **pseudo-anonymous** system, not true anonymity. For complete anonymity, use dedicated platforms like Tor or SecureDrop.
